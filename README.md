## Design
### Color Scheme

The **Ramen Bar** website employs a vibrant and appetizing color scheme designed to stimulate the senses and reflect the lively, flavorful experience of enjoying a bowl of ramen. The warm hues of orange (#F57C00), yellow (#FFC107), and red (#DC3545) dominate the palette, evoking energy, passion, and warmth, which are all integral to the dining experience. These colors not only capture the essence of the ramen culture but also enhance the appetite of visitors. The green (#28A745) offers a fresh contrast, symbolizing the wholesome and balanced ingredients often found in ramen dishes. 

Meanwhile, the cool blue (#17A2B8) adds a calming balance to the vibrant tones, maintaining visual harmony throughout the site. For the blog and text-heavy sections, dim gray (#696969) provides a neutral, easy-to-read foundation that complements the vivid colors without overwhelming the viewer. By incorporating Bootstrap’s default colors, the design achieves both consistency and a modern aesthetic, creating a visually delightful experience that mirrors the essence of Ramen Bar.

### Brand Logo and Favicon

The Ramen Bar logo is a vibrant and inviting design that reflects the essence of the brand. Featuring a steaming bowl of ramen with chopsticks resting atop, the logo symbolizes the warmth and authenticity of Japanese ramen culture. The intricate details, including the colorful ingredients and dynamic presentation, evoke a sense of appetite and culinary artistry, perfectly aligning with the restaurant's mission.

The favicon, a simple yet bold "RB" in a warm orange and dim gray color scheme, complements the logo while providing a clean and professional representation of the brand in browser tabs and bookmarks. Together, the logo and favicon create a cohesive visual identity, enhancing the brand's recognition and appeal to ramen enthusiasts.

### Typography

The Ramen Bar website features Berkshire Swash for headings, infusing a touch of playfulness and charm into the design. This decorative serif font evokes the warmth and authenticity of a cozy ramen shop, making it the perfect choice for a casual dining experience. The flowing, hand-crafted appearance of Berkshire Swash reflects the artistry behind crafting a perfect bowl of ramen, tying the typography to the site's theme of comfort, culture, and delicious food.

![Berkshire Swash-title](/documentation/poppins-title.webp)

For body text, Open Sans ensures clarity and readability, creating a welcoming and approachable vibe for visitors. Its clean, modern style complements the dynamic Berkshire Swash headings, providing a harmonious balance between tradition and contemporary design. Together, these fonts enhance the inviting and casual feel of the Ramen Bar website, making it easy for users to explore menus, engage with blogs, and immerse themselves in the warm atmosphere of ramen culture.

  django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: You're using the staticfiles app without having set the STATIC_ROOT setting to a filesystem path.
  ```
- **Solution**:
  1. Added the following settings in `settings.py`:
     ```python
     STATIC_URL = 'static/'
     STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
     STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
     ```
  2. Created the necessary directories:
     ```bash
     mkdir static staticfiles
     ```
  3. Ran `python manage.py collectstatic` to resolve the issue.

---

     ```python
     def reservation(request):
         if request.method == 'POST':
             form = ReservationForm(request.POST)
             if form.is_valid():
                 reservation = form.save()
                 return redirect('confirmation', reservation_number=reservation.reservation_number)
         else:
             form = ReservationForm()
         return render(request, 'reservation/reservation.html', {'form': form})
     ```
  2. Ensured the form code was properly added to the template.

---

#### **6. Cloudinary Configuration for Menu Management**
- **Issue**: Menu images were not being uploaded due to missing Cloudinary configuration.

     from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField

     class Menu(models.Model):
         name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
         description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
         price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
         category = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=CATEGORY_CHOICES, default='ramen')
         image = CloudinaryField('image', folder="menu_images/")
         is_available = models.BooleanField(default=True)
         created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

         def __str__(self):
             return self.name
     ```
  2. Ran migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

---

Based on the screenshot, I understand you are referring to a Markdown style that includes **code blocks** for commands and descriptions, often displayed in "boxes." Below is the updated debugging history formatted in a style consistent with your screenshot:

---

## Debugging History for Blog Features

### 1. **Comment Editing and Deletion Issues**

#### Problem
- The modal for confirming comment edits appeared at the wrong timing.
- Editing functionality sometimes did not save changes correctly.
- Inline editing forms occasionally displayed rendering errors.

#### Solution
```bash
# Fixed the timing of the modal appearance
- Adjusted the `confirmSaveChanges` JavaScript function to ensure the modal appears after clicking the "Submit" button in the edit form.
- Correctly mapped the `comment_form` instance to the respective comment in the template (`blog_detail.html`).
- Updated inline form rendering logic with unique ID management to avoid conflicts.
```

---

### 2. **Incorrect Button States**

#### Problem
- Both "Edit" and "Delete" buttons displayed inconsistently styled buttons.
- Buttons sometimes appeared for unauthorized users or in duplicate.

#### Solution
```bash
# Updated button logic and styling
- Rewrote the conditional rendering logic in `blog_detail.html` to restrict button display to comment authors only.
- Standardized button styles using Bootstrap 4 classes.
```

---

### 3. **LIKE Button Implementation**

#### Problem
- The LIKE functionality allowed unliking, which was against the specification.
- Button styles and text were inconsistent with the desired design.
- AJAX requests failed occasionally due to missing CSRF tokens.

#### Solution
```bash
# Added CSRF token dynamically and restricted unliking
- Restricted "unlike" by disabling the LIKE button after it is clicked.
- Added `Font Awesome` thumbs-up icons for the LIKE button.
- Enhanced `views.py` to handle already liked posts and provide proper JSON responses.
- Integrated CSRF tokens dynamically into AJAX headers.
```

---

### 4. **Rendering Errors in JavaScript and HTML**

#### Problem
- JavaScript syntax errors caused runtime failures in confirmation modals.
- Variables in `confirmSaveChanges` and `confirmDelete` functions were not properly scoped or referenced.

#### Solution
```bash
# Fixed JavaScript syntax errors
- Corrected syntax and used template literals for dynamic ID references.
- Added error handling and console logging for debugging missing elements.
```

---

### 5. **Comments Misaligned with Post Content**

#### Problem
- Comment submission boxes were not aligned properly with the layout.
- Headers for "Edit Comment" and "Leave a Comment" were inconsistent.

#### Solution
```bash
# Updated layout and styling for comments
- Adjusted the `blog_detail.html` layout using the Bootstrap 4 grid system to align comments to the right sidebar.
- Standardized headers to user-friendly text like "Leave a Comment" and "Edit Your Comment."
```

---

### 6. **Miscellaneous Fixes**

```bash
- Removed redundant code for comment approval since it was not required for the current setup.
- Added tooltips and improved button descriptions for accessibility.
- Improved error messages in `views.py` to be more user-friendly.
```

---

### **Code Highlights**

#### Improved `views.py`
```python
# Enhanced error handling for comment_edit and comment_delete
if comment.author != request.user:
    messages.error(request, "You are not authorized to edit this comment.")
    return redirect('blog_detail', id=blog.id)
```

#### Enhanced `blog_detail.html`
```html
<!-- LIKE Button -->
<button id="likeButton" 
        class="btn btn-primary" 
        data-id="{{ blog.id }}" 
        {% if user in blog.likes.all %} disabled {% endif %}>
    <i class="fa {% if user in blog.likes.all %}fa-thumbs-up{% else %}fa-thumbs-o-up{% endif %}"></i>
    {% if user in blog.likes.all %}Liked{% else %}Like{% endif %}
</button>
```

Great to hear that it worked! Below is a summary of the debugging process, including the issues you faced and how you fixed them:

Debug History and Issue Fixes

1. Issue: Embedded Git repository (booking-app)

	•	Problem: During the process of trying to push changes to GitHub, you encountered an issue with an embedded Git repository (booking-app) that had been accidentally added inside your current repository.
	•	Error Message:

hint: You've added another git repository inside your current repository.
hint: Clones of the outer repository will not contain the contents of
hint: the embedded repository and will not know how to obtain it.


	•	Solution:
	•	You identified that the booking-app folder had been added to version control by mistake as an embedded Git repository.
	•	To resolve this, you had to remove the booking-app directory from Git’s staging area using:

git rm --cached -r booking-app


	•	This removed the embedded repository from being tracked by Git.

2. Issue: Merge Conflict during Rebase

	•	Problem: When you tried to pull the latest changes from the remote repository with git pull --rebase, you encountered a merge conflict in settings.py.
	•	Error Message:

error: could not apply 12b939d... Fix: Remove embedded repository booking-app from version control


	•	Solution:
	•	The conflict was resolved by manually editing settings.py to ensure that both sets of changes were properly integrated.
	•	After resolving the conflict, you marked the file as resolved by staging it using:

git add my_project/settings.py


	•	You continued the rebase process with:

git rebase --continue


	•	This successfully resolved the conflict and completed the rebase.

3. Issue: Commit Message and Editor Confusion

	•	Problem: While trying to continue the rebase, you were stuck in an editor screen (most likely Nano or another editor), where the commit message was unclear. You were unable to close the editor and complete the rebase process.
	•	Solution:
	•	You identified that the editor was asking you to confirm the commit message for the rebase.
	•	After closing the editor (by pressing Ctrl+X in Nano, or following the instructions for the editor in use), the rebase was continued.
	•	This allowed the rebase to finish and commit the changes successfully.

4. Issue: File Removal and Cleanup

	•	Problem: Some files (such as templates/account/login.html, templates/account/logout.html, and templates/account/signup.html) were deleted as part of the fixes to clean up the repository.
	•	Solution:
	•	The files were properly removed and staged for commit, and the cleanup process was confirmed with:

git status



5. Issue: Pushing Changes to Remote Repository

	•	Problem: After completing the rebase, you couldn’t push the changes to the remote repository because of a conflict between your local and remote branches.
	•	Solution:
	•	You used the following command to rebase and incorporate any changes from the remote repository:

git pull origin main --rebase


	•	After resolving the conflicts and ensuring everything was updated, you successfully pushed the changes to the remote repository using:

git push origin main
