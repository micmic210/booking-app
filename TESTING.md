# Ramen Bar - Testing
![Ramen Bar](/documentation/home-page.webp)

Welcome to the testing documentation for the Ramen Bar website. As a student developer, I have dedicated my efforts to creating a high-quality, user-friendly platform for ramen enthusiasts to explore and make reservations. Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, and Django, this project integrates modern web development tools to deliver a seamless experience. This document provides an overview of the testing strategies and methodologies I employed to ensure the functionality, performance, and responsiveness of the site. From verifying design consistency across devices to ensuring smooth reservation workflows and debugging complex interactions, this guide outlines the steps taken to make the Ramen Bar website an enjoyable and reliable platform for every visitor.

### Manual Testing
#### Testing User Stories

### User Stories

The Ramen Bar website focuses on providing a user-friendly and engaging experience. Visitors can browse a categorized menu, make and cancel reservations, and contact the restaurant through an intuitive interface. A blog section allows users to explore articles on ramen culture and engage through comments and likes. Registered users benefit from additional features such as comment management and personalization. Admins can efficiently manage menu items, reservations, and blog content via the Django admin panel. These features ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for both users and administrators.

Hereâ€™s a refined debug history section that selects and organizes 10 good debugging instances based on complexity, relevance, and impact:

---

## Debug History

### 1. **Cloudinary Configuration Error**
- **Issue**: A typo in the `CLOUDINARY_URL` environment variable caused a startup failure with the error:  
  ```
  ValueError: Invalid CLOUDINARY_URL scheme. Expecting to start with 'cloudinary://'
  ```
- **Solution**:
  - Corrected the `CLOUDINARY_URL` in `env.py` to the proper format:
    ```
    cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME
    ```
  - Restarted the server to verify the fix.
- **Outcome**: The issue was resolved, and media uploads functioned correctly.

---

### 2. **Static Files Configuration Error**
- **Issue**: Running `collectstatic` resulted in:
  ```
  django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: You're using the staticfiles app without having set the STATIC_ROOT setting to a filesystem path.
  ```
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `settings.py` to include:
    ```python
    STATIC_URL = 'static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    ```
  - Created necessary directories and ran `collectstatic`.
- **Outcome**: Static files were successfully collected, and the site rendered correctly.

---

### 3. **CSRF Verification Error**
- **Issue**: Deployed site displayed a `403 Forbidden` error due to failed CSRF verification.
- **Solution**:
  - Added `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in `settings.py` for the deployment domain.
  - Configured the CSRF variable in Heroku:
    ```
    heroku config:set CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://<your-app>.herokuapp.com
    ```
- **Outcome**: Fixed the issue, and forms now work on the live site.

---

### 4. **Menu Item Image Upload Failure**
- **Issue**: Menu images failed to upload due to missing Cloudinary configuration.
- **Solution**:
  - Updated the `menu/models.py` to include:
    ```python
    from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField
    image = CloudinaryField('image', folder='menu_images/')
    ```
  - Ran migrations to apply changes.
- **Outcome**: Images successfully uploaded and displayed on the menu page.

---

### 5. **Reservation Form Not Displayed**
- **Issue**: The reservation form was not rendering on `reservation.html` due to a missing context variable in the view.
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed the view to include:
    ```python
    def reservation(request):
        form = ReservationForm()
        return render(request, 'reservation.html', {'form': form})
    ```
- **Outcome**: The reservation form displayed correctly.

---

### 6. **LIKE Button Count Not Updating**
- **Issue**: The LIKE button did not update the count dynamically.
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented AJAX to update the LIKE count without reloading the page:
    ```javascript
    $('#likeButton').click(function() {
        $.ajax({
            url: '/like-post/',
            method: 'POST',
            data: { post_id: postId },
            success: function(response) {
                $('#likeCount').text(response.likes);
            }
        });
    });
    ```
- **Outcome**: The LIKE button now updates in real-time.

---

### 7. **Pagination Not Displaying Properly**
- **Issue**: Pagination links for the blog posts were broken due to an incorrect URL pattern.
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed the `urls.py` to include:
    ```python
    path('blog/', BlogListView.as_view(), name='blog'),
    ```
  - Added `paginator` logic in the template.
- **Outcome**: Pagination displayed and functioned correctly.

---

### 8. **Edit Comment Not Saving**
- **Issue**: Edited comments were not being saved due to a missing form `action` attribute in the HTML.
- **Solution**:
  - Updated the comment edit form in `blog_detail.html` to include:
    ```html
    <form action="{% url 'edit_comment' comment.id %}" method="POST">
    ```
- **Outcome**: Edited comments now save as expected.

---

### 9. **Heroku Deployment Failure**
- **Issue**: Deployment failed with the error:
  ```
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gunicorn'
  ```
- **Solution**:
  - Added `gunicorn` to `requirements.txt` and redeployed:
    ```
    pip install gunicorn
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    git add requirements.txt
    git commit -m "Add gunicorn"
    git push heroku main
    ```
- **Outcome**: Deployment succeeded.

---

### 10. **404 Error for Contact Page**
- **Issue**: Accessing the contact page resulted in a 404 error due to a missing entry in `urls.py`.
- **Solution**:
  - Added the contact view to `urls.py`:
    ```python
    path('contact/', ContactView.as_view(), name='contact'),
    ```
- **Outcome**: The contact page loaded successfully.

---

### Key Learnings
- Ensure environment variables are accurately configured.
- Use AJAX for dynamic UI updates.
- Always test URL patterns and context variables in views.
- Deploy incrementally to catch issues early.
